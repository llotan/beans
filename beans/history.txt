- added morpho param intensivity, changed filters red,  blue, green, yellow
- merged n contours to 1 in process detect beans
2019.09.19 got beta ver device with short chanel, tested, found best timespan between detect and blow bean
2019.09.1x got beta ver device with long chanel, tested, found best timespan between detect and blow bean

2019.09.12 adjustmented cameras, valves. Tested theim
2019.09.11 got alfa ver device, tested work with PLC
- improved GUI

2019.09.04 
- fixed error in saving data of experement
- linked  blobs from two cameras in runtime
- prepare report for two  cameras
- prepared data for develope reports
- debuged & checked standart report 
- impoved measure module (crated object model, tested  it on standart report )

2019.08.20
- created standart report (based on morpho filter)
- added filters (morpho parameters on OpenCV):
   - elogation (eccentricity)
   - convexity - area, perimetr
   - roundness
   - Rmax, Rmin, Rmax-Rmin
   - orientation & max/min axis
- added form "Morpho fiter"

2019.08.06
- combine all  modules in program
- made installation and auto update from micropik.org
- get PLC from Chereck - wrote driver work with this PLC, made depended changed in program ( PLC manage 24 valves )

- made changed in program depend new control box(managed light, vibro table)
- developed module save result of experiment  to xml
- moved parameters of program to config and added form for changed them, for user

2019.07.20
- Created procedure detect one bean from two cameras.
- Developed module attach / deattach  any filter(morphoparameters) to detection process.
- Made filters(morphoparameters): red,area,perimeter, Rmin, moment of blob,  convexity.
- Developed component for showing process of detection beans.
- Detect channel  of bean for turn on valve (one from 9

2019.06.12
- Remade project   for one camera
- Adjusted project for Morphious V1 (add manage light, breathe,  vibration table)
- Move project  from opencv 2 to opencv3 (for move calc from CPU to GPU)

2019.05.10
- Created algorithm detect red beans,       using opencv2. 
- Created algorithm merge bean from  lines
- Tested and adjusted project on first setup with two cameras .

2019.04.06
- Wrote driver  for mater-slave  work of cameras
